# 100 Days Of Code - Log - SeifSG / Seif Sgayer

### Day 1: August 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've created my personal website repo and submitted some code into it. Also made some cards on Trello.

**Thoughts**: Starting this challenge is a great way to keep tracking of coding outside the day job. It's a motivation to keep writing code on daily basis.

### Day 2: August 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learning time managment. Some code to my website. Learning about what possible javascript libraries I can use.

**Thoughts**: It's been so difficult to keep up with a busy schedual. Well, the challenge is so important to me aswell. So I'm giving it more priority.

### Day 3: August 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Going back to complete some of freeCodeCamp challenges. The twitch api challenge. Also the Reactjs lessons on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: Hmm... I should really finish that website of mine haha. But instead I went to do the FCC challenge because it is more fun. and most likely because I am planning to implement twitch api in my site soon. And Reactjs seems like reeaaally worth it.
